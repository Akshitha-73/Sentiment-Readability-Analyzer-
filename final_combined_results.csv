robot for automated trading what we do banking financials securities and insurance blackcoffer development of ea robot for automated trading by ajay bidyarthy september 15 2024 7699 objective the goal of this project is to build an expert advisor ea robot that automates trading by using predictions generated from a machine learning ml model the ea will operate in realtime leveraging both historical and live data to make buysell decisions data can be obtained via two primary methods api a free version that provides limited data for a single currency pair and a paid version offering access to multiple pairs trading platforms fx pro or xm which will serve as direct sources for realtime trading data additionally the ea robot will use an mql5 script that defines the trading strategy enabling automated trading on any metatrader 5 mt5 platform the core focus is to train an ml model for predictive trading integrate data streams and implement a scalable mql5 strategy for execution key steps 1 project setup api and platform access obtain api credentials for both free and paid versions set up fx pro or xm trading platforms and retrieve login details ensure compatibility with metatrader 5 mt5 for seamless integration test api connection test api endpoints to verify data retrieval for currency pairs this ensures realtime data flow for both historical and live trading 2 data retrieval and preparation api data integration set up api connections to retrieve historical and live trading data the free version will provide access to data for a single currency pair eg eurusd while the paid version allows for multiple pairs eg gbpusd gold usdcad etc fx pro xm data handling integrate fx pro and xm platforms for data reading and trade execution use python and mt5 libraries to retrieve realtime data for selected currency pairs historical data storage collect historical data for model training storing it in a structured format eg csv for further processing 3 model development and training feature engineering compute technical indicators eg rsi macd ema for selected currency pairs using historical data generate buysell signals for training ensuring the data reflects actual market patterns model training develop and train the model using historical data to predict buysell signals by choosing appropriate ml model like xgboost lstm or reinforcement learning focus on ensuring that the model can generalize well to unseen data and respond effectively to market changes model evaluation evaluate model performance based on metrics like accuracy precision recall and profit optimization adjust and finetune hyperparameters for improved predictive performance 4 backtesting and performance evaluation backtesting framework setup develop a system to test the model on historical data performance metrics definition define relevant metrics eg sharpe ratio drawdown strategy backtesting run the model through historical data to evaluate performance results analysis analyze backtesting results and identify areas for improvement 5 realtime data integration realtime data handling set up continuous data feeds via apis or fx proxm platforms fetching realtime trading data at regular intervals eg 15 minutes ensure that the data is cleaned preprocessed and normalized on the fly for live prediction purposes technical indicators calculation compute technical indicators on realtime data ensuring the model uses uptodate market conditions prediction script develop scripts to apply the trained model to realtime data and generate buysell predictions 6 mql5 script development strategy implementation develop an mql5 script that includes the trading strategy based on model predictions are creates an interface between the ai system and trading platform the

the problem the sports coaching organization esra salih faced the challenge of efficiently allocating coaches to various programs across different schools the allocation process was previously manual and inefficient leading to inadequate coachprogram matching and inefficient use of coaches time the organization needed a system that could automatically assign coaches to programs based on specific criteria such as coach availability program preferences and the number of students enrolled in each program our solution we developed a custom system that divides the academic year into different terms and assigns coaches to programs based on a set of criteria the system filters coaches based on their preferences and allocates them to programs efficiently it ensures that coaches do not have to travel excessively and that their total work time does not exceed a certain threshold once a coach is assigned to a program they are allocated for subsequent program days ensuring consistency the development process will involve several stages understanding the data well analyze the data to identify the relevant variables and constraints these may include the locations of installations the duration of installations the availability of team members and customer preferences defining the objective and constraints the objective will be to minimize the total travel time or maximize the number of installations completed within a given time frame the constraints will include the geographical distances between locations the working hours of team members and the specific requirements of each installation implementing the algorithm well use an optimization algorithm such as the traveling salesman problem tsp solver to find the optimal routes the algorithm will consider all possible routes and choose the one that best meets the objectives while adhering to the constraints running simulations to ensure the feasibility of the model well run simulations using different scenarios and adjust the parameters as needed saving the output the final output will be the suggested schedules which can then be reviewed and approved by the relevant parties in terms of technology well use python a popular language for data analysis and machine learning well also use the anaconda distribution which provides a powerful environment for scientific computing and data analysis solution architecture the system is built on a custom logic implementation that filters programs for a particular date and checks the past history of the program to see if a coach was assigned before if not it allocates a new coach based on their availability and feasibility to reach the program location in time a filtered list of coaches based on preferences like agegroup and level is created to aid this process deliverables a python script implementing the cvrptw model test data and scripts for simulating different scenarios documentation explaining how to use the model and interpret the results tech

installs and services for many departments like drain plumbing excavation hvac and bath organization wants to track some kpis based on the given monthly target and tracking should be department wise or technician wise the dashboard will show tracking the pace of kpis so that they can understand how the organization is performing in each department in terms of number of jobs revenue etc and also they want to understand how technicians are working to achieve their monthly target dashboard has two basic views one for admin persons and one for users only when an admin person logged in to the web app he will see the dashboard as an iframe and he can filter date range department technician to see the progress of department and technicians when a user logged in to the web app he will see the user dashboard view after autofiltering his name so that he can only view his data in the dashboard scope of this project is limited to atoz dependable service but scaleable to auto user filter in dashboard datasource each user will see his data only in the dashboard that brings data security and integrity our solution define attributes and entities that needed to determine all the kpis for tracking group kpis in categories and subcategories for example as per work defined in organization can be divided into three main categories called service sales and install and each of these categories can be divided into 5 departments called drain bath hvac plumbing and excavation so any department will have the same kpis for the same category you can refer the document httpsdrivegooglecomfiled131epqtbetvrkfdwkxq86te35jcne3ntxviewuspsharing determine calculations for each kpis design dashboard in looker studio and add components need to track those kpis and use those kpi calculations in dashboard to get actual and target values determine the admin view and users view of the dashboard report and create a separate dashboard for users in admin create three pages service sales and install for users create 3 separate dashboard each belongs to one of the main category add datasource for each of the main categories service sales and install assign these datasource to the correct page same data source will be reused in users dashboard determine what type of charts needed to full fill the client requirement add them and configure accordingly create embedded url and provide those to the developer team to use as iframe in the primary product wwwatozscoreboardcom create a user filter parameter default params for the user dashboard and make this as

Blackcoffer Insights,home our success stories analyzing the impact of female ceo appointments on company stock prices blackcoffer our success stories research academia analyzing the impact of female ceo appointments on company stock prices by ajay bidyarthy august 25 2024 6038 client background client a leading research institution worldwide industry type rd products services rd higher education organization size 10000 the problem to find out if the appointment of a female ceos affected the stock prices of that company the appointment of a new ceo is often a significant event for a company potentially influencing its strategic direction investor confidence and market performance this study seeks to determine whether the appointment of a female ceo has a measurable impact on the companys stock prices specifically the research aims to explore if there is a statistically significant change in stock price trends following the appointment of a female ceo and whether the market reacts differently compared to appointments of male ceos understanding this relationship can provide insights into investor perceptions and the broader implications of leadership diversity on corporate performance our solution to analyze whether the appointment of a female ceo affected the stock prices of a company we followed these steps 1 define the hypotheses null hypothesis h0 the appointment of a female ceo has no effect on the stock prices of the company alternative hypothesis h1 the appointment of a female ceo affects the stock prices of the company 2 data collection gather data on the stock prices of the company before and after the appointment of the female ceo make sure to gather data for a sufficient number of companies to ensure reliability and to control for other factors that might affect stock prices 3 data analysis calculate the average stock prices before and after the appointment of the female ceo conduct a statistical test to determine if there is a significant difference between the two averages statistical tests for this scenario include the ttest or anova 4 interpretation if the pvalue from the statistical test is less than the significance level typically 005 then you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the appointment of a female ceo has a significant effect on the stock prices of the company if the pvalue is greater than the significance level you fail to reject the null hypothesis suggesting that there is no significant effect of the appointment of a female ceo on the stock prices 5 reporting results presented our findings including the statistical analysis and interpretation in a clear and concise manner discussed the implications of the results and any further research that may be warranted solution architecture we implemented timeseries analysis solution using various libraries heres a architecture using python 1 data collection use libraries like pandas numpy or requests to collect and store historical data from relevant sources for financial data we used apis like alpha vantage or yahoo finance 2 data preparation and exploration utilize pandas for data manipulation and exploration this includes tasks such as cleaning data handling missing values and visualizing timeseries data using matplotlib or seaborn 3 modelling depending on the characteristics of our data we chose an appropriate timeseries model from libraries like statsmodels or prophet for forecasting for more advanced models like deep learningbased approaches you might use tensorflow or pytorch 4 parameter estimation use builtin functions within the chosen libraries to estimate the parameters of the selected model for example statsmodels provides functions for fitting arima models 5 model evaluation evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics we implemented custom evaluation functions or use builtin functions from libraries like scikitlearn 6 forecasting use the fitted model to make predictions for future time points most timeseries libraries provide functions to easily forecast future values 7 interpretation and visualization interpret the results of our analysis and visualize the forecasts along with historical data using matplotlib seaborn deliverables hypothesis testing statistical models business insights tech stack tools used python vs code pandas for data manipulation matplotlib or seaborn for data visualization statsmodels or prophet for timeseries modelling scikitlearn for model evaluation languagetechniques used python for programming timeseries analysis techniques such as arima exponential smoothing etc data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values data normalization etc models used arima skills used data manipulation and preprocessing using pandas timeseries modeling and analysis statistical analysis and interpretation data visualization using matplotlib or seaborn machine learning techniques for model evaluation python programming skills what are the technical challenges faced during project execution 1 seasonality and trend detection challenge identifying and modeling complex seasonality and trends in the data accurately 2 forecasting uncertainty challenge providing accurate uncertainty estimates for timeseries forecasts is crucial but challenging how the technical challenges were solved 1 seasonality and trend detection solution utilize techniques such as seasonal decomposition eg stl decomposition which decomposes the time series into seasonal trend and residual components making it easier to model each component individually differencing can also be applied to remove trends or seasonality making the data stationary and easier to model advanced timeseries models like seasonal arima sarima or seasonal exponential smoothing methods can capture seasonal patterns and trends effectively by incorporating seasonal parameters into the model structure 2 forecasting uncertainty solution implement probabilistic forecasting methods such as bayesian inference which allows for the estimation of probability distributions for future observations monte carlo simulations involve generating multiple forecast paths by sampling from the predictive distribution providing a range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities bootstrapping is another technique where multiple bootstrap samples are drawn from historical data and forecasts are generated for each sample enabling the calculation of prediction intervals and quantifying forecast uncertainty these methods help in quantifying and communicating the uncertainty inherent in timeseries forecasts aiding decisionmaking processes summarize summarized httpsblackcoffercom this project was done by the blackcoffer team a

backend system solution architecture solution overview the solution architecture is designed to integrate various components to provide a seamless user experience the architecture includes custom qlora model training training opensource models like llama and mixtral with domainspecific data to ensure accurate and relevant responses twilio sms integration utilizing twilios api to send and receive sms for appointment confirmations reminders and other notifications rag for confidential data implementing retrievalaugmented generation rag using chromadb for secure and efficient access to confidential data api development with fastapi building restful apis using fastapi to handle communication between the frontend and backend and to manage data transactions backend functionality handling all other functionalities such as booking appointments dues management and order tracking through robust backend api services qlora model training qlora qlora is the extended version of lora which works by quantizing the precision of the weight parameters in the pretrained llm to 4bit precision typically parameters of trained models are stored in a 32bit format but qlora compresses them to a 4bit format this reduces the memory footprint of the llm making it possible to finetune it on a single gpu this method significantly reduces the memory footprint making it possible to run llm models on less powerful hardware including consumer gpus the qlora model training involves the following steps data collection gather domainspecific data including faqs appointment details and patient interactions preprocessing clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for model training training utilize qlora training platforms to train the llama or mistral models on gpu resources finetuning finetune the model using qlora models evaluation evaluate the model performance and make necessary adjustments technology stack programming language python javascript ai api fastapi backend

acquisition prada in the following phases which included 1 get pics for existing eos elected officials 2 get new eos and pictures 3 run qa checks regularly on eos 4 get data from government facebook pages 5 geospatial project create a new version of provided kml without using google earth creating a nested directories which contained description and mapurl at the designated location 6 get data of us states and countiesincluding boroughs and parishes by building an automated generated structured data that allows a non programmer to create a config for each page allowing a bot to scrap and update the data our solution we created an automated python scripts for designated phases with respective requirements solutions to various type of problems varied such as most of data scrapping automation was done through python developed scripts including the geospatial kml task in addition to this different ranges of data was scrapped generated directed output for the respective tasks in the form of csv format so the users main aim requirement was achieved ie a non programmer could create a config and initiate a bot to scrap the required data solution architecture the majority task of project consisted of web data scraping automation so a high level overview and specific implementation details of project shall will be as follows web scraping framework python as a coding language was used in almost all of the tasks and the framework used for data scraping included beautifulsoup selenium and web drivers these libraries provide tools and functionalities to navigate web pages extract data and handle various html elements data extraction and parsing use the selected web scraping library to extract the desired data from the web pages provided either in the data sheet or within the websites of urls given in the sheet this involves locating html elements applying filters or selectors and parsing the extracted data data processing followed by data extraction it was cleansed transformed and aggregated to a structured form such as pandas data frame followed by a csv file in the case of geospatial task it resulted to generation of nested folders in a kml file data storage the how and where to store the scrapped data was determined which is local file system in the form of csv comma separated values as it was the appropriate data storage solution according to need of the project in addition to this the geospatial task had the output in the form of kml file as polygons inside directories of nested folders deliverables tasks outputs csvkmlxlsx python scripts

beautiful soup selenium pandas numpy simplekml re regular expressions languagetechniques used python programming language it is an interpreted language which allows quick prototyping and interactive coding its versatility can be is one of the reasons for its major applications different libraries and tools were used in this project for various data solutions beautiful soup a python library used for web scraping and parsing html and xml documents it provides a convenient way to extract from the said files it eases out the work flow from parsing to data extraction and encoding handling as well selenium a python library used for web browser automation like chrome firefox safari and others it interacts with elements such as clicking buttons filling out forms and selecting drop down options in this project we used it in chrome selenium web driver was used for web automation it acted as bridge between python code and the web browser pandas it is pythons versatile library that provides high performance data structure tools and it is built on top of numpy data frame is one of its key feature due to which this library was used this key feature allows efficient manipulation slicing and filtering of structured data numpy it is also a python library aka numerical python as it is a fundamental library for scientific computing in python simplekml it is a python package which enables you to generate kml with as little effort as possible re regular expressions it is a powerful tool in python sued for pattern matching and manipulations of strings skills used python programming web fundamentals web scrapping using libraries such as bs selenium data cleaning and processing problem solving and debugging kml structure and handling using pythons programming databases used none all the structured data was in the form of either python data frames csv or excel sheets what are the technical challenges faced during project execution firstly some of the web urls were not accessible because they were restricted to particular range of ips of that region couldnt fetch whole data through beautiful soup as it couldnt parse whole tags list of us counties wasnt provided in the given resource links how the technical challenges were solved used vpn for accessing official sites which were not generally accessible used selenium web driver to automate the direction at urls which fetched complete html tags of the desired webpages performed a search and created structure data of list of counties of each state which was used as input to gain web urls of counties of us business impact enhanced analysis web scraping allows businesses to gather valuable data from various websites this information can provide insights to desired aim and objectives enabling businesses to make informed realtime monitoring and upgradation web scraping can enable business to monitor changes or updates on website in realtime this can be useful for tracking regulatory changes it keeps the business and its data updated increased efficiency automation eliminated the need for manual data collection saving time and resources with automated web scraping business can extract large amount data quickly accurately improving overall operational efficiency project snapshots chrome driver initiated chrome driver visiting the directed links and accessing the image urls directed to next link

performance alternative assets competitive intelligence limited partners customized benchmarks service providers fund of funds ma and financial services organization size 100 the problem extract fundingrelated data from news articles from 1000 websites such as company name funded amount participated investors and other details create a web app to manage the extraction of funding data our solution there were 1000 websites from fundingrelated articles so we couldnt make a crawler for each website so we used an inbuilt web crawler provided by elasticsearch when we have extracted articles then we need to extract funding related information company name fund amount and investors participated etc then we decided to use nlps questionanswering method in which we need to train transformers to extract fundingrelated information first we have created some keywords based approaches to create labels for each field we need to extract to train models after that we have trained distil bert model on labelled data on aws ec2s gpu server we applied this approach for all the fields we need to extract we got 90 accuracy for the company name field and for other fields we got 80 accuracy to manage and view all the fields of extracted funding data we created a web app using python flask in this we created several pages to show extracted raw data by crawler cleaned data after applying some cleaning functions and final output which have all the fields we also created admin dashboard pages to show daily crawling status how many articles processed in one day total final output etc solution architecture deliverables flask web app elasticsearch crawler tools used flask spacy nltk pandas numpy transformers elasticsearch etc languagetechniques used question answering in nlp web scraping web application flask python models used distilbert model encorewebsm pre trained model of spacy skills used nlp data analysis flask web app pandas numpy transformers fastapi elasticsearch etc databases used elasticsearch database web cloud servers used aws what are the technical challenges faced during project execution the client wanted to extract data from 1000 different websites and if we make any crawler it only works for one website so it was not possible to create a 1000 web crawler how to extract funding information from an article it is very difficult to extract that type of information from normal python code by defining keywords because every website has different types of articles how the technical challenges were solved to solve web crawlerrelated issues we used elasticsearch web crawler which is very fast and can extract multiple websites at a time in this we need to create an engine and add websites that we want to scrape after that we added some keywords to extract only fundingrelated articles we set up this crawler to run every hour so we can get new articles every hour to extract fundingrelated information we collected articles from different websites and created labels for each field we wanted to extract after that we have finetuned the transformers distilbert model on our labeled data we used these models to extract fundingrelated information we also created an automated python script that uses these model on every extracted article and extracts fundingrelated information business impact this fundingrelated data would be used in two ways from this project companies can find suitable investors for their startups companies can search for investors based on industry verticals etc and find investors to help their startups investors can use it to find a startup in which they want to invest based on their preferences like industry verticals etc project snapshots minimum 10 pictures contact details here are my contact

stories banking securities and insurance it return on advertising spend dashboard marketing automation and analytics using etl and dashboard by ajay bidyarthy july 21 2023 9630 client background client a leading ad firm in india industry type ads services ads marketing and promotions organization size 100 the problem the main problem that was addressed in this project was the manual calculation of return on advertising spend roas due to the lack of a centralized platform for running ads the clients ads were spread across multiple revenue generating platforms including google adsense adx and ezoic while the spending was managed through the google ads platform at that time the client lacked a centralized dashboard or website that could effectively calculate roas by integrating revenue and cost streams this fragmentation made it challenging for the client to track and evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns therefore a comprehensive solution was developed and implemented providing a centralized platform for calculating roas aligning revenue and cost data from various sources and enabling informed decisionmaking regarding advertising investments our solution we developed a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating return on advertising spend roas and centralizing their advertising data the solution involved collecting data from four different apis google ads api for spending data google adsense api ad manager api and ezoic data for revenue data to ensure compatibility we utilized an extract transform load etl tool to convert the data received from each api which was in different formats into a standardized format storing them pandas dataframe for both revenue and spending data the transformed data was then stored in a postgres database for easy access and management to automate the data extraction process we implemented an etl script that runs twice daily via cronjob on a digital ocean vm ensuring the latest data is always available moreover we designed a backend api using the flask framework this api fetched the required data from the postgres db allowing users to retrieve relevant information efficiently finally we implemented a roas dashboard frontend to display the calculated roas using the fetched values the dashboard provided a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to track and monitor their advertising performance with our solution in place the client could now easily monitor roas over time access consolidated data and make informed decisions regarding their advertising investments solution architecture the solution architecture involved a multistep process to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating roas and centralizing their advertising data data was collected from various apis including google ads api google adsense api ad manager api and ezoic data and transformed into a standardized format using an etl tool the transformed data was stored in a postgres database and a backend api was developed using the flask framework to fetch the required data the calculated roas was then displayed on a next js dashboard providing users with an intuitive interface to track and analyze their advertising performance deliverables etl tool deployment on digital ocean backend api next js backend frontend roas dashboard tools used google ads api google adsense api adx api ezoic api python 39 jupyter notebook flask digital ocean droplet next js frontendbackend stack vuexy template for roas dashboard languagetechniques used python 39 flask api digitalocean droplet functional programming in python etl tool skills used python git deployment data engineering web development using next js databases used we used postgresql database for the project web cloud servers used digital ocean droplet what are the technical challenges faced during project execution some of the technical challenges encountered were ensuring data integrity during the transformation process deployment of docker image on vm setting up an automated etl pipeline adding ssl certificate to backend api how the technical challenges were solved 1 ensuring data integrity implemented checks cleansing and validation to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data 2 docker image deployment on vm configured vm to support docker image for etl and deployed the image for seamless execution 3 setting up automated etl pipeline automated data extraction transformation and loading processes for efficient data management via cronjob 4 adding ssl certificate to backend api secured backend api with ssl certificate enabling encrypted communication for enhanced data protection business impact the implemented solution had a significant positive impact on the clients business by providing a centralized platform for calculating roas and integrating data from multiple revenuegenerating platforms the client gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns the availability of realtime consolidated data enabled informed decisionmaking regarding advertising investments the userfriendly interface of the raos dashboard allowed the client to easily track and monitor their advertising performance leading to improved campaign optimization and potentially higher returns on advertising spend overall the solution streamlined the clients advertising operations resulting in increased efficiency and improved business outcomes project snapshots here are the

app will be able to communicate with the tag manager servers you can then use tag managers webbased user interface to set up tags establish triggers that cause your tag to fire when certain events occur and create variables that can be used to simplify and automate your tag configurationsa tag manager container can replace all other manuallycoded tags on a site or app including tags from google ads google analytics floodlight and 3rd party tags google data studio dashboards the dashboards preview the important metrics related to the websites using graphs tables to understand the trends patterns in the users the following steps were carried out for the project get the important metrics for website performance like the number of users visiting the websites the average session duration graphs related to the user acquisition like number of new users vs the returning users this is related to the main website for the sub websites track the number of users clicking on specific buttons through this i understand the user flow compare between the number of users entering the website and those clicking on buttons track the metrics related to goal conversion like goal completions goal conversion rate goal completion rate and different goals and present it using visualisations provide data insights in the end providing scope of improvements and recommendations project deliverables the main deliverable for this project were dashboards on google data studio depicting important metrics related to website performance there were three sub websites for which there were two types of views each each of the views had several buttons related to the product the project was about finding the user flow and event flow on the views tools used google analytics to track events goal conversions and analyse the traffic sourcesmedium the top viewed pages and the top cities and countries google tag manager to set up the tags and triggers of button clicks page visits as events in google analytics google data studio to visually represent important metrics like impressions clicks goal completions using google analytics skills used digital analysis data analysis data visualisations google analytics what are the technical challenges faced during project execution the main technical challenge faced was that there were multiple events setup in google analytics for one event and thus identifying a particular one was difficult how the technical challenges were solved we had to communicate with the client to clarify about the event names although this took some time but it was necessary since accurateness of data is very essential for the project business impact this analysis helps to improve website performance understanding user behavior understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the uiux to increase their potential users having insight into your clients behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale such data could include a clients persona such as their age location and areas of interest some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include dashboard metrics some examples are pages per visit bounce rate and average duration of each visit conversion rate this indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved be it a sale of a product a free giveaway or a subscription to a newsletter sourcemedium analysis this analysis helps in understanding the traffic sources and medium on the website this helps the businesses to work on strengthening the traffic sources to get better reach to the target audience traffic analysis the overall traffic analysis for the website provides information regarding the important metrics like usersavg session duration and goal completions according to different sourcemedium this will help the business to analyse different traffic channels performances project

data pipeline fieldpulse to gcp mysql we have created a data pipeline that uses web scraping to fetch data from fieldpulse it makes a get request to the fieldpulse api and the api returns raw data convert this into json format then in dataframe now create new tables in gcp mysql and insertupdate the data accordingly insertion updation of data insertion if any data fetched from fieldpulse is not present in their respective database table then insert that data in the table updation if any data fetched from fieldpulse is present in their respective database table then update that data in the

for accessing fieldpulse api we struggled a lot to get the desired data from fieldpulse setting up connection from gcp mysql to gds due to firewall and vpn connection was not set up as ip address changes while using vpn it was showing an error every time someone tries to connect to mysql from their google studio account how the technical challenges were solved getting data from fieldpulse we did use web scraping for this we explored all the api addresses we connected to each possible address and got the data then explored the data made a list of addresses which contains data of our interest also data is stored in a scattered and cascaded manner in fieldpulse with ids so we had to fetch a lot of extra tables and then join multiple tables to get a desired data table setting up connection from gcp mysql to gds to resolve this issue we did as below set up the ip address in gcp mysql security to 0000 so that any system can access it vpn issue resolved enabled the ssl in gcp

pipeline converts it into dataframe then writesupdates it into airtable the pipeline is deployed in a server that runs every night it fetches the data from quickbooks api and writesupdates to airtable airtable to powerbi as there is no connector available to sync data from airtable to powerbi we have used pagination using dax queries to get data from web sources ie airtable api pagination fetches

stated in quickbooks developer guide we need refresh token to access quickbooks api and it expires after 101 days but that is not the case it usually expires within 2 to 4 days depending on how frequently we access the api in that case our deployed pipeline does not work if the token expired getting data from airtable to powerbi as powerbi has no airtable data source connector to fetch data from airtable we did use web source connector using airtable data web links it only fetches the 1st page that is 100 rows from airtable base because airtable api gives only 100 rowsrequest dynamic data source refresh issue as the url of airtable bases data changes based on the size of data powerbi recognizes it as dynamic data source hence it gives the error dynamic data source refresh error in powerbi service how the technical challenges were solved quickbooks refresh token expired issue as the token may expire anytime after 2 days so to resolve this we have added a gui element in pipeline so that if token expires a pop up will appear asking for a new refresh token until the consumer enters a valid new token from their quickbook developer account a pop up will keep coming and pipeline will be paused once the user enters a new token the pipeline will continue working getting data from airtable to powerbi to resolve this issue we have used pagination technique as below first request airtable api with proper url apikey and blankoffset dataurlapikeyapikeyoffsetblankoffset this request returns first 100 rows of data and a new offset value now replace the previous offset value with a new offset value in the url and again make an api request this request will return the next 100 rows of data and a new offset do this until you get a null offset null offset means all data has been fetched this is how we get all the data of any size from airtable bases dynamic data source refresh issue the above mentioned pagination technique converts dynamic urls of airtable bases data into static urls so powerbi gives no error as it has been converted to a static data source now the client can refresh the dashboard manually by clicking the refresh button or can set automatic refresh

2021 10397 client background client a leading business school worldwide industry type rd services rd innovation organization size 100 project objective objective of this project is to research and collect news article data sourcing from canada based on the keyword project description there were 3 phases of the project phase 1 data collection and selection data related to anyone coming to canada new comers data related to anyone coming to canada new comers canadian policy to new comers ie from any country to canada data containing news press think tanks government policy documents or research institutions releasing the news or press about the news source should be limited to canada only time span 2005 to 2021 output excel having urls or the documents along with the source type keywords and date on which that article is posted phase 2 documents text data extraction develop tool to collect and extract data from each url clean and save the texts in the text documents phase 3 textual analysis sentiment analysis analysis of readability topic modelling our solution we provide them with completed phase 1 in an excel sheet and ongoing samples for phase 2 also work for phase 3 has been started in between to complete the project as soon as possible in a best way project deliverables there is a file containing excel sheet and a word file containing a summary of the dataset and folders of text files containing samples of data from phase 2 tools used python pycharm jupyter notebook microsoft excel google chrome is used to complete different phases of this project languagetechniques used python programming language is used to do web scraping automation data engineering in this project models used sdlc is a process followed for a software project within a software organization it consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop maintain replace and alter or enhance specific software the life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process we are using iterative waterfall sdlc model as we have to follow our development of software in phases and we also need feedback on every step of the development of our project so as to keep track of the occurring changes with every step figure 1 sdlc iterative waterfall model skills used data scraping cleaning preprocessing and creating data pipelines are used in this project databases used we used the traditional way of storing the data ie file systems what are the technical challenges faced during project execution there were a lot of challenges we faced during the project execution as on the internet raw data is available to us so to search for the important data specifically related to canada only with a lot of keywords was a challenging part for us then if we somehow manage to do the task by automating it upto some extent only we are required to find the dates of the articles news think tanks documents etc that was also a challenging part while working on phase 2 we need to scrape the data from the urls so sometimes the news articles were removed from the website which we earlier took in our datasets which cause problems in extracting the data then cleaning the webpages was also challenge for us because this project is for research so data is important to us so it was difficult to take only that data from website which we require and are most important how the technical challenges were solved below are the points used to solve the above technical challenges we used sitemaps of websites to find different articles that we require according to the keywords manual research was done to find out which url will solve the purpose manual checking of results of automation tools that we created was done to find the dates of the articles we wrote multiple regular expressions that will find the match for the dates that we need also manual checking was done after that to scrape removed webpages we used wayback machine or google archives which stores all the deleted webpages to clean the data we filtered out various html tags classes ids by using regex manual research project snapshots previous article lipsync automation for celebrities and

has nested json data within its attributes so abstracts data from the nested columns into a new dataframe completed handling complex nested json formed columns abstracted from nested json then need to handle the missing data by mapping it with another index dataset further missing values for certain attributes were handled by mean value and 0 substitution this task involves numerous pandas operations along with multiple python functions further done exploratory data analysis on the cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix and plotting certain seaborn graphs between strong correlated attributes our solution worked on accessing json data done tree analysis on json sample data both the file was too big for reading and applying some python code in jupyternb so performed chunking of stocktwitslegacymessages201510txt with chunk size 20000 rows at a time similarly trying for the other file created a list of all the chunked files of json data concat all the files in that list the file has nested json data within its attributes so abstracted data from the nested columns into a new dataframe completed handling complex nested json formed columns abstracted from nested json renamed the columns with identification eg id as entitiesid likewise for others so that while merging the data doesnt create any issue completed forming preprocessed csv file for 1st json file which output2015csv for second file size was 3gb so splitted the file into ten parts and then individually solved nested json for all these parts like done in the 1st file finally concat them into one then handled columns arrangements and removed unwanted columns and finally removed dictionary representation from entitysentiments column completed forming preprocessed csv file for 2nd json file which is outputstocktwits2017csv the cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix and plotting certain seaborn graphs between strong correlated attributes further done exploratory data analysis on the cleaned
